<h2>Topology terms</h2>
<ul>
<li><i>metric d(p,q)</i> that specifies the scalar distance between every pair of points</li>
<li><i>connected</li> two distinct points cannot be adjacent to each other; they only be connected to another by an uncountably infinite bunch of <b>intermediate points.</b></li>
<li>ÖÐÎÄTopologiests solve that mystery with the idea of <b>limit points</b></li>
</ul>
