<h2>Delaunay Triangle concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li>circumcircle</li>
Tree no collinear point uniquely determine a circle, this circle is called the circumcircle
<li>Delaunay Triangle</li>
If there is no points in this circumcircle then this circumcircle is said <b>empty</b> and 
this triangle is Delaunay triangle. (open set?? points can on the circumcircle?)
<li>Existence and Uniquesless</li>
Given a point set the Delaunay triangle is exists but not always unque if there is more than 
three points lie on a common <b>empty circle</b>
Tree no collinear point uniquely determine a circle, this circle is called the circumcircle
<li>Delaunay subdivision (related closed with Voronoi diagram</li>
<li>Strongly Delaunay ( pay attention here the triangle is not appended after Delaunay, so 
it can be edges--Delaunay edge!)</li>
<li>这里我使用UTF8编码</li>
</ul>
