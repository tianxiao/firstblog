title: Manifolds  Maps  Homeomorphisms
---
<h2>Maps and Homeomorphisms</h2>
Two metric spaces are considered to be the same if the points that comprise them are connected the same way.
<br>
<b>Homeomorphisms</b> is a important concept to the topology theory we can use the easy representation to sutdy 
the topology space.
<br>
<b>Continuity</b> is just step on the way to <b>topological equivalence</b>, because a continuous function can 
map many points to a single point in the target space like the y=x^2+y^2 map and true equivalence is marked by a 
<i>homeomorphisms</i> a <b>one-to-one</b> function from one space to another that possesses both <b>continuity</b>
 and a <b> continuous </b> inverse, so that the limit points are preserved in both directions.
<br><b>Topological equivalence
<h2>Manifolds</h2>
A manifolds is a set of points that is locally connected in a particular way.
