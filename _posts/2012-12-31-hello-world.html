Definition 5(convex polyhedron)
Convex polyhedra(polyhedron pl.)
The proper faces of a convex polyhedron C are the polyhedra that
can be generated by taking the intersection of C with a <b>heperplane</b>
that intersects C's <b>boundary</b> but not C's interior; such a hyperplane
is called a supporting heperplane of C
For example, the proper faces of a cube are six squares, twelve edges, and 
eight vertices.
